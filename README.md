# NoN Volunteer
https://non-volunteer.netlify.app/

## In the NonVolunteer website, each user can find event he wants take part and register. There is an option to save the event to your calendar. Each event has start and end date.

### We've been working on a project in team. The team members are three people. We worked together very well and the project was completed in time. We learned so much about React JS, design and teamwork.
